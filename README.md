# Insurance_Protocol

This protocol allows users to create and manage their own insurance policies, without the need for intermediaries like insurance companies. Smart contracts are used to automate the process of underwriting, premium payments, and claims processing.

# Description

Peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance is a type of insurance protocol that allows individuals to pool their resources together to create their own insurance pool. In a traditional insurance model, insurance companies collect premiums from policyholders, and use those funds to pay claims and cover administrative costs. In a P2P insurance model, however, the policyholders themselves are responsible for managing the pool of funds.
